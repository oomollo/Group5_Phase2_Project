**Business Understanding**
This project is a representation of a suppositional scenario in which Microsoft is entering a business of creating movies. I as a Data Scientist is assigned to help Microsoft decide what type of film they should be creating by translating my findings into actionable insights.
In this notebook I am going to explore the relationship between movie's success and movie's finance, movie's genre, movie's runtime and production budget profit. It is my decision to use profit and ROI as the predominant indicators of success.
